# Overview

This guide is intended for the students in CS 340 who want to develop their final project using React.js with Node/Express/mySQL.

This guide walks through everything from getting the tools setup to work on the app, setting up the infrastructure required to build and run your app, and building and (eventually) deploying the app either to OSU's flip server or Heroku.

There are a few assumptions that are made when this guide is written:

- You have basic familiarity with Javascript and MySQL syntax
- You are capable of opening a terminal and navigating using basic commands like `cd`, , etc.
- You have access to OSU's flip servers, and have been issued a MySQL database in class.
  - This guide can be easily adapted for development on your local machine if you are so inclined.
